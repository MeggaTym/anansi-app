  <h3>How to Play</h3>
  <p>
    Anansi is a mathematical challenge requiring some level of thinking. The aim
    of the game is to remove the spiders surrounding the grid, and to do this;
    <br>
    You're a given a 3x3 grid in which values 1-9 can be inserted, and
    no duplicates are allowed. The spiders are removed from each row and/column
    only if the sum of the 3 values in the row/column equals to 15.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>Level 1</h3>
  <p>
    Level 1 is complete when each row and column's sum is equivalent to 15 i.e all spiders are removed
    and replaced by bees.
  </p>
  <h3>Level 2</h3>
  <p>
    Level 2 is complete when each row and column's sum is equivalent to 15. The diagonal sum also has to be equal to 15.
    Then all the spiders will removed.

  <h3>Level 3</h3>
