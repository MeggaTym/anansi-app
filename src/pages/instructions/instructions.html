  <h3>How to Play</h3>
  <p>
    AnansiApp is a mathematical challenge requring some level of thinking. The aim
    of the game is to remove the spiders surrounding the grid, and to do this;
    <br>
    You're a given a 3x3 grid in which values 1-9 can be inserted, and
    no duplicates are allowed. The spiders are removed from each row and/column
    only if the sum of the 3 values in the row/column equals to 15.
    <br>
    On Level 2, the sum diagonally should be equal to 15
  </p>
  <h3>Colors and Objects</h3>
  <p>
    The <span class="danger">red</span> color means that the current entered value is
    a duplicate.
    <br>
    The <span class="done">green</span> means the grid is valid and complete.
    <br>
    The spiders around the grid mean the row/column sum is not 15
